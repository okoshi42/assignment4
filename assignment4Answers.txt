1. bubble sort makes more swaps than insertion or selection sort, and writing takes more time than reading
2. selection sort always performs O(n) swaps, while insertion sort runs more efficiently the more sorted the array already is
3. A custom class needs some form of comparative values. 
These algorithms are known as comparative sorting algorithms, 
and you would need to implement a comparison operator in C++

4. std::sort is faster on a fundamental level because it uses more efficient algorithms, as well as probably being well optimized
